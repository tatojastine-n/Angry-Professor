# Angry-Professor
This C# program determines if a class is canceled based on student arrival times. The `angryProfessor` function counts how many students arrive on time (time â‰¤ 0) and returns "YES" if fewer than `k` students are on time (class canceled), otherwise "NO". The `Main` method reads multiple test cases, student counts, arrival times, and outputs the result for each case.
